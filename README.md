<h1>To-Do List</h1><br>
This is my project to make a basic To-Do List. This project can help you complete your tasks on time and help you remembring which tasks are to be done before a specific time.<br>
<h3>How to add new tasks:</h3><br>
In the "tasks" add your task that you have to do and add the date by which you want to complete it and set a remainder for the due date if you want to.<br> 
<h3>Potential feature</h3><br>
This is a simple and user friendly project.<br>
By using it, you can increase your productivity because if you have the due date infront of you, you will do the task more efficiently adn quickly.<br>
It will reduce the behaviour of procastination.<br><br>
<h3>Steps to resolve conflicts:</h3><br>
You can simply open an advance text editor or IDE and there would be an option to resolve conflict by removing one cange or another or by adding the both changes.
But if you are using CLI(terminal) for merging and resolving conflicts, follow these steps:-<br>
1. merge the branches and you will see a warning i.e. conflict.<br>
2. open the file in text editor like nano, vim etc.<br>
There you will se some characters like: (>>>>>>> or MAIN) above the conflicted lines. You can simply remove the deired lines below these that you don't want to be in repo, if you wanna keep both, you can just remove the characters and save the file.
